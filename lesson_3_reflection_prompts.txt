When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	To keep all changes in the cloud, also to collaborate when working with others on a project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	So that if working on a feature locally, it is first completed as to not mix up things

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	branches are made when it is desirable to have different versions of the project, like experimantal and production.
	clones are used to copy repositories, either from remote github repo or from a local repository.
	Forks behave like clone but its only from github tp github. When you fork a repo. 
	You'll get the same repo on your github account as a fork also leadinng back to the original author.
